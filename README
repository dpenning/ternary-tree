CS450 Assignment 4

Running the program
------------------------------
Using the Makefile, you can run make test-{0-4} to run the file tests/test-{0-4}.data and the results will go into tests/test-{0-4}.out. 
The default lisp is set to clisp as it was the one defined in class.
However, the LISP variable can be changed in the Makefile to any lisp that allows for input redirection.
Results are included with the submission for test-{0-4} produced by clisp. 

test-0.data is the small test data that was provided by Dr Finkel on the assignment page.
test-1.data is the large test data provided by Dr Finkel at http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS450/data.ternary.txt
test-2.data is a NIL list to make sure the program handles it correctly.
test-3.data is a test that has the same number repeated 3 times to make sure the tree is formed correctly.
test-4.data is a set of 100 randomly generated numbers between 1 and 100 to test with random data.
